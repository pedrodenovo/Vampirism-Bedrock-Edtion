Welcome to the official wiki for the Vampirism: Bedrock Edtion addon, based on the vampirism mod that was created between 2014 and 2015, which transforms the standard Minecraft experience by adding vampires, hunters and much more to the world. The great thing about this mod is that it allows the player to become any of them.

# Adaptation
Vampirism: Bedrock Edtion" is the name of an adaptation of this very memorable Java mod for Bedrock. The aim is to make an addon as similar as possible to the original (despite Bedrock's limitations).
