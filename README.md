# Addon description
Vampires are fast, powerful and bloodthirsty creatures who avoid sunlight but thrive in the darkness of night, and the most exciting thing: you can become one!

This addon makes it possible to transform into a vampire, with all its advantages and disadvantages.

After being bitten by a vampire or manually injecting vampire blood, you acquire the "Sanguinare Vampiris" effect, which gradually converts you into one of the children of the night.
